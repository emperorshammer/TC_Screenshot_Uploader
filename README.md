# TC Screenshot Uploader
A program used to automatically upload game screenshots to the EHTC database.

TC Screenshot Uploader now supports all TIE Corps official games and also supports both PvE / COOP and PvP modes playing solo or within a group.

The program will retain the PIN numbers and names your group members if you are gaming within a group for ease of use and will prompt you before each submission if there are
any changes to your groupâ€™s makeup.
Because of this it may be useful to write down the PIN numbers and names of the people you are playing with so allow you to easily reconfigure your group in the app
should it change.

# Disclaimer:
The user of this software is responsible for ensuring that all submissions comply with current platform and COO policies. Failure to do so WILL result in your submission being rejected.

# Antivirus Notice.
The .exe version of this software WILL trigger a false positive antivirus alert. This is because the software moves screenshots to a "Submitted" folder after it submits the report.
Antivirus software rightly identifies this as an act of Malware because of this. 
To use the .exe version you will most likely need to make an exception for this program within your antivirus software.
This issue does not affect the .py version.

# Instructions for use:
Bear in mind this program is very early in its development and completely experimental at this point.

Download both "TC Screenshot Uploader.exe" and "settings.ini" from:
